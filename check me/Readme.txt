Hi there 
hope you doing well .

So about the first problem "backend logs, but they show a database error on the initial boot."

actually i'm trying alot to fix it but i don't even know how to do this also i thought when i use the conifgref and keyref the problem will gone but it didn't 
so if you just can help me by refaring some ways to fix this i'll be thankful 



now about the secound problem which is "shared the backend logs" , so you told me that i have to create acc in the app for example to see log in the backend about the creation 

the main problem i face here that is my app is not going correctly for some reasons when i'm trying to open it using the url "ae9b2a581c783495c8d7a67dd40f73a3-155399785.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com"

it opens and loading the frontend perfectly no problems , but here is when i'm try to create account or using the backend nothing happend and it seems like it has
an error or somthing .. (shown in the snpashot " open me" 

so as you can see it shows unknown error and i think there is no response.

finally i would appriciate your help and watiing for feedback

Thank You.
